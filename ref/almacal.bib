  abstract = {Measurements of the cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) indicate that emission from many extragalactic phenomena, including star formation and black hole accretion, in the Universe can be obscured by dust. Resolving the CIB to study the population of galaxies in which this activity takes place is a major goal of submillimetre astronomy. Here, we present interferometric 650 {$\mu$}m submillimetre number counts. Using the Band 8 data from the ALMACAL survey, we have analysed 81 ALMA calibrator fields together covering a total area of 5.5 arcmin2. The typical central rms in these fields is {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 with the deepest maps reaching {$\sigma$} = 47 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Multiwavelength coverage from ALMACAL allows us to exclude contamination from jets associated with the calibrators. However, residual contamination by jets and lensing remain a possibility. Using a signal-to-noise threshold of 4.5{$\sigma$} , we find 21 dusty, star-forming galaxies with 650 {$\mu$}m flux densities of {$\geq$}0.7mJy. At the detection limit we resolve 100 per cent of the CIB at 650 {$\mu$}m, a significant improvement compared to low-resolution studies at similar wavelength. We have therefore identified all the sources contributing to the EBL at 650 {$\mu$}m and predict that the contribution from objects with flux 0.7 mJy will be small.},

  abstract = {We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, ALMACAL. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of {$\sim$}25 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on 5{$\sigma$} detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S1.2 mm0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 {$\mu$}m and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2\texttimes. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs\textemdash representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies\textemdash in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.},
