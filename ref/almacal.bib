  abstract = {We present statistics of 133 faint 1.2 mm continuum sources detected in  about 120 deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) pointing data that include all the archival deep data available by 2015 June. We derive number counts of 1.2 mm continuum sources down to 0.02 mJy partly with the assistance of gravitational lensing, and find that the total integrated 1.2 mm flux of the securely identified sources is \{22.9\}-5.6+6.7 Jy deg-2 which corresponds to \{104\}-25+31\% of the extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by Cosmic Background Explorer observations. These results suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02 mJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with {$\lessequivlnt$}0.02 mJy contribute negligibly to the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in this very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint ALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias bg by the counts-in-cells technique, and place a stringent upper limit of bg {$<$} 3.5 that is not similar to bg values of massive distant red galaxies and submillimeter galaxies but comparable to those of UV-bright, star-forming BzK galaxies (sBzKs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Moreover, in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify optical-NIR counterparts for 59\% of our faint ALMA sources, the majority of which have luminosities, colors, and the IRX-{$\beta$} relation the same as sBzKs and LBGs. We thus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor, high-z galaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint ALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared brightness.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) indicate that emission from many extragalactic phenomena, including star formation and black hole accretion, in the Universe can be obscured by dust. Resolving the CIB to study the population of galaxies in which this activity takes place is a major goal of submillimetre astronomy. Here, we present interferometric 650 {$\mu$}m submillimetre number counts. Using the Band 8 data from the ALMACAL survey, we have analysed 81 ALMA calibrator fields together covering a total area of 5.5 arcmin2. The typical central rms in these fields is {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 with the deepest maps reaching {$\sigma$} = 47 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Multiwavelength coverage from ALMACAL allows us to exclude contamination from jets associated with the calibrators. However, residual contamination by jets and lensing remain a possibility. Using a signal-to-noise threshold of 4.5{$\sigma$} , we find 21 dusty, star-forming galaxies with 650 {$\mu$}m flux densities of {$\geq$}0.7mJy. At the detection limit we resolve 100 per cent of the CIB at 650 {$\mu$}m, a significant improvement compared to low-resolution studies at similar wavelength. We have therefore identified all the sources contributing to the EBL at 650 {$\mu$}m and predict that the contribution from objects with flux 0.7 mJy will be small.},

Using all the available observational data, it is shown that the counts of radio sources are consistent with evolutionary cosmologies in which the properties of a class of powerful radio sources, tentatively identified with quasi-stellar sources, evolve with epoch. From the satisfactory models, it is found that: (1) the local p(P) luminosity function may be derived ; (2) the mode of evolution of these powerful sources with epoch may be determined ; and (3) the universe is isotropic to a redshift of at least 4.},

  abstract = {We present a new cosmological galaxy formation model,  {$\nu$}2GC, as an updated version of our previous model {$\nu$}GC. We adopt the so-called "semi-analytic" approach, in which the formation history of dark matter halos is computed by N-body simulations, while the baryon physics such as gas cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback are simply modeled by phenomenological equations. Major updates of the model are as follows: (1) the merger trees of dark matter halos are constructed in state-of-the-art N-body simulations, (2) we introduce the formation and evolution process of supermassive black holes and the suppression of gas cooling due to active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, (3) we include heating of the intergalactic gas by the cosmic UV background, and (4) we tune some free parameters related to the astrophysical processes using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our N-body simulations of dark matter halos have unprecedented box size and mass resolution (the largest simulation contains 550 billion particles in a 1.12 Gpc h-1 box), enabling the study of much smaller and rarer objects. The model was tuned to fit the luminosity functions of local galaxies and mass function of neutral hydrogen. Local observations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the size-magnitude relation of spiral galaxies, and the scaling relation between the bulge mass and black hole mass were well reproduced by the model. Moreover, the model also reproduced well the cosmic star formation history and redshift evolution of rest-frame K-band luminosity functions. The numerical catalog of the simulated galaxies and AGNs is publicly available on the web.},

We find a reasonable agreement between the model galaxies within this sample and the properties of the observed submm population, such as their star formation rates (SFRs) at z {$<$} 3, redshift distribution, and many integrated galaxy properties. We find that the median redshift of the S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy model population is z {$\approx$} 2.5, and that they are massive galaxies (M* {$\sim$} 1011 M{$\odot$}) with high dust masses (Mdust {$\sim$} 108 M{$\odot$}), gas fractions (fgas {$\approx$} 50 per cent), and SFRs (\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\approx$} 100 M{$\odot$} yr-1). In addition, we find that they have major and minor merger fractions similar to the general population, suggesting that mergers are not the sole driver of the high SFRs in the model submm galaxies. Instead, the S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy model galaxies yield high SFRs primarily because they maintain a significant gas reservoir as a result of hosting an undermassive black hole relative to comparably massive galaxies. Not all `highly star-forming' (\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\geq$} 80 M{$\odot$} yr-1) EAGLE galaxies have submm fluxes S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy. We investigate the nature of these highly star-forming `Submm-Faint' galaxies (i.e. \textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\geq$} 80 M{$\odot$} yr-1 but S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$<$} 1 mJy) and find that they are similar to the model submm galaxies, being gas rich and hosting undermassive black holes. However, they are also typically at higher redshifts (z {$>$} 4) and are lower mass (M* {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$}). These typically higher redshift galaxies show stronger evidence for having been triggered by major mergers, and critically, they are likely missed by most current submm surveys due to their higher dust temperatures and lower dust masses.},

  abstract = {We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide, and deep submillimeter (submm) survey, ALMACAL. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of {$\sim$}25 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on 5{$\sigma$} detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S1.2 mm0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 {$\mu$}m and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2\texttimes. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs\textemdash representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies\textemdash in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.},

Strong evidence is found for galaxy luminosity evolution in the blue counts and in the faint galaxy color distribution. The red counts show evidence for slower rates of galaxy luminosity evolution and, here, the effects of evolution and q(0) are comparable. The red count models are well enough determined to reject world models with q(0) not less than about 0.5, if galaxies were known to have undergone little luminosity evolution over a look-back time corresponding to a redshift of 0.5.},

In our previous work, we studied the statistical properties of ultraviolet-selected star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. We populate the same cosmological simulations with SMGs by calculating the reprocessing of stellar light by dust grains into far-infrared to millimetre wavebands in a self-consistent manner. We generate light-cone outputs to compare directly the statistical properties of the simulated SMGs with available observations. Our model reproduces the submillimetre source number counts and the clustering amplitude. We show that bright SMGs with flux S {$>$} 1 mJy reside in haloes with masses of {$\sim$}1013 M{$\odot$} and have stellar masses greater than 1011 M{$\odot$}. The angular cross-correlation between the SMGs and Lyman {$\alpha$} emitters is significantly weaker than that between the SMGs and Lyman-break galaxies. The cross-correlation is also weaker than the autocorrelation of the SMGs. The redshift distribution of the SMGs shows a broad peak at z {$\sim$} 2, where bright SMGs contribute significantly to the global cosmic star formation rate density. Our model predicts that there are hundreds of SMGs with S {$>$} 0.1 mJy at z {$>$} 5 per 1 deg2 field. Such SMGs can be detected by ALMA.},

  abstract = {We present bright galaxy number counts in five broad bands (u', g', r', i', z') from imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The counts are derived from two independent stripes of imaging scans along the celestial equator, one each toward the northern and the southern Galactic cap, covering about 230 and 210 deg2, respectively. A careful study is made to verify the reliability of the photometric catalog. For galaxies brighter than r*=16, the catalog produced by automated software is examined against eye inspection of all objects. Statistically meaningful results on the galaxy counts are obtained in the magnitude range 12{$<$}=r*{$<$}=21, using a sample of 900,000 galaxies. The counts from the two stripes differ by about 30\% at magnitudes brighter than r*=15.5, consistent with a local 2 {$\sigma$} fluctuation due to large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution. The shape of the number counts-magnitude relation brighter than r*=16 is well characterized by N\textasciitilde 100.6m, the relation expected for a homogeneous galaxy distribution in a ``Euclidean'' universe. In the magnitude range 16814 bands. We compute the luminosity density of the universe at zero redshift in the five SDSS bands and in the B band. We find LB=2.4+/-0.4\texttimes 108 Lsolar h Mpc-3, for a reasonably wide range of parameters of the Schechter luminosity function in the B band.
