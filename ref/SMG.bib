  abstract = {A cosmologically signi\"ycant population of very luminous high-redshift galaxies has recently been discovered at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths. Advances in submm detector technologies have opened this new window on the distant Universe. Here we discuss the properties of the high-redshift submm galaxies, their signi\"ycance for our understanding of the process of galaxy formation, and the selection e ects that apply to deep submm surveys. The submm galaxies generate a signi\"ycant fraction of the energy output of all the galaxies in the early Universe. We emphasize the importance of studying a complete sample of submm galaxies, and stress that because they are typically very faint in other wavebands, these follow-up observations are very challenging. Finally, we discuss the surveys that will be made using the next generation of submm-wave instruments under development. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 1013 L{$\odot$} with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both spacebased and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the bestunderstood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.},

  abstract = {Deep, pencil-beam surveys from ALMA at 1.1-1.3 mm have uncovered an apparent absence of high-redshift dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions peaking around z {$\sim$} 1.5-2.5. This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4 and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward-evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at z {$<$} 2.5 determined by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ({$\sim$}1-10 deg2). We find that measured 1.1-1.3 mm number counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the IRLF at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 2.5 instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4. Recent studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at z {$>$} 4 may be particularly dust-poor, but we find that their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law, even by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust (T dust {$\approx$} 30 K) spectral energy distributions. Our models suggest that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of z {$>$} 4 early universe obscured starbursts. The most promising avenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will come from future ALMA 2 mm blank-field surveys covering a few hundred arcmin2 and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3 mm data sets.},

  abstract = {Though half of cosmic starlight is absorbed by dust and reradiated at  long wavelengths (3 {$\mu$}m-3 mm), constraints on the infrared through the millimeter galaxy luminosity function (or the ``IRLF'') are poor in comparison to the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical galaxy luminosity functions, particularly at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.5. Here, we present a backward evolution model for interpreting number counts, redshift distributions, and cross-band flux density correlations in the infrared and submillimeter sky, from 70 {$\mu$}m-2 mm, using a model for the IRLF out to the epoch of reionization. Mock submillimeter maps are generated by injecting sources according to the prescribed IRLF and flux densities drawn from model spectral energy distributions that mirror the distribution of SEDs observed in 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 5 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We explore two extreme hypothetical case studies: a dust-poor early universe model, where DSFGs contribute negligibly ({$<$}10\%) to the integrated star formation rate density at z {$>$} 4 and an alternate dust-rich early universe model, where DSFGs dominate {$\sim$}90\% of z {$>$} 4 star formation. We find that current submm/mm data sets do not clearly rule out either of these extreme models. We suggest that future surveys at 2 mm will be crucial to measuring the IRLF beyond z {$\sim$} 4. The model framework developed in this paper serves as a unique tool for the interpretation of multiwavelength IR/submm extragalactic data sets, and will enable more refined constraints on the IRLF than can be made from direct measurements of individual galaxies' integrated dust emission.},

  abstract = {We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts using the Keck I telescope for a sample of 73 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), with a median 850  m flux density of 5.7 mJy, for which precise positions are available through their faint radio emission. The galaxies lie at redshifts out to z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3:6, with a median redshift of 2.2 and an interquartile range z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1:7\textendash 2.8. Modeling a purely submillimeter flux\textendash limited sample, based on the expected selection function for our radio-identified sample, suggests a median redshift of 2.3, with a redshift distribution remarkably similar to the optically and radio-selected quasars. The observed redshift distributions are similar for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and starburst subsamples. The median RAB is 24.6 for the sample. However, the dust-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosities of the galaxies rarely hint at the huge bolometric luminosities indicated by their radio/submillimeter emission, with the effect that the true luminosity can be underestimated by a median factor of \$120 for SMGs with pure starburst spectra. Radio and submillimeter observations are thus essential to select the most luminous highredshift galaxies. The 850  m, radio, and redshift data are used to estimate the dust temperatures and characterize photometric redshifts. Using 450  m measurements for a subset of our sample, we confirm that a median dust temperature of Td {$\frac{1}{4}$} 36 \AE{} 7 K, derived on the assumption that the local far-infrared (FIR)\textendash radio correlation applies at high redshift, is reasonable. Individual 450  m detections are consistent with the local radio-FIR relation holding at z \$ 2. This median Td is lower than that estimated for similarly luminous IRAS 60  m galaxies locally. We demonstrate that dust temperature variations make it impossible to estimate redshifts for individual SGMs to better than \'Az ' 1 using simple long-wavelength photometric methods. We calculate total infrared and bolometric luminosities (the median infrared luminosity estimated from the radio is 8:5\th\`A74::46 ; 1012 L ), construct a luminosity function, and quantify the strong evolution of the submillimeter population across z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:5\textendash 3.5 relative to local IRAS galaxies. We use the bolometric luminosities and UV-spectral classifications to determine a lower limit to the AGN content of the population and measure directly the varying the contribution of highly obscured, luminous galaxies to the luminosity density history of the universe for the first time. We conclude that bright submillimeter galaxies contribute a comparable star formation density to Lyman break galaxies at z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2\textendash 3, and including galaxies below our submillimeter flux limit, this population may be the dominant site of massive star formation at this epoch. The rapid evolution of SMGs and QSO populations contrasts with that seen in bolometrically lower luminosity galaxy samples selected in the rest-frame UV and suggests a close link between SMGs and the formation and evolution of the galactic halos that host QSOs.},

However, at these redshifts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is higher, approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gas observed in the local universe. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the warmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB affects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission (e.g., carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (1) it provides an additional source of (both dust and gas) heating and (2) it is a non-negligible background against which the line and continuum emission are measured. We show that these two competing processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties of high-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. We quantify these effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of the intrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the CMB as a function of frequency, redshift, and temperature. We discuss implications on the derived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data. Specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severely underestimated for cold systems if the impact of the CMB is not properly taken into account.},

We derive number counts of 1.2 mm continuum sources down to 0.02 mJy partly with the assistance of gravitational lensing, and find that the total integrated 1.2 mm flux of the securely identified sources is \{22.9\}-5.6+6.7 Jy deg-2 which corresponds to \{104\}-25+31\% of the extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by Cosmic Background Explorer observations. These results suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02 mJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with {$\lessequivlnt$}0.02 mJy contribute negligibly to the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in this very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint ALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias bg by the counts-in-cells technique, and place a stringent upper limit of bg {$<$} 3.5 that is not similar to bg values of massive distant red galaxies and submillimeter galaxies but comparable to those of UV-bright, star-forming BzK galaxies (sBzKs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Moreover, in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify optical-NIR counterparts for 59\% of our faint ALMA sources, the majority of which have luminosities, colors, and the IRX-{$\beta$} relation the same as sBzKs and LBGs. We thus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor, high-z galaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint ALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared brightness.},

This is the largest survey of its kind at 850 {$\mu$}m, increasing the sample size of 850 {$\mu$}m selected submillimetre galaxies by an order of magnitude. The wide 850 {$\mu$}m survey component of S2CLS covers the extragalactic fields: UKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22 and GOODS-North. The average 1{$\sigma$} depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy beam-1, approaching the SCUBA-2 850 {$\mu$}m confusion limit, which we determine to be {$\sigma$}c {$\approx$} 0.8 mJy beam-1. We measure the 850 {$\mu$}m number counts, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to approximately 4 per cent at S850 {$\approx$} 3 mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate field-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5\textdegree -1\textdegree{} scales are generally within 50 per cent of the S2CLS mean for S850 {$>$} 3 mJy, with scatter consistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties, although there is a marginal (2{$\sigma$}) density enhancement in GOODS-North. The observed counts are in reasonable agreement with recent phenomenological and semi-analytic models, although determining the shape of the faint-end slope (S850 {$<$} 3 mJy) remains a key test. The large solid angle of S2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S850 {$>$} 10 mJy there are approximately 10 sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive up-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of 850 {$\mu$}m emission, and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies.

  abstract = {We present a detailed study of SMM02399-0136, a hyperluminous, active galaxy selected from a submm survey of the distant Universe. This galaxy is the brightest source in the fields of six rich, lensing clusters, with a total area of 0.01deg\^2, that we have mapped with a sensitivity of \textasciitilde 2mJybeam\^-1 at 850mum. We identify a compact optical counterpart with an apparent magnitude of B\textasciitilde 23 and a low surface-brightness companion \textasciitilde 3arcsec away. Our spectroscopy shows that both components have the same redshift; z=2.803+/-0.003. The emission line widths, FWHM\textasciitilde =1000-1500kms\^-1, and line ratios, along with the compact morphology and high luminosity (M\_B\textasciitilde =-24.0) of the galaxy, indicate that SMM02399-0136 contains a rare dust-embedded, narrow-line or type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). The source is gravitationally lensed by the foreground cluster, amplifying its apparent luminosity by a factor of 2.5, and our detailed lens model allows us to accurately correct for this. Taking the amplification into account, we estimate that SMM02399-0136 is intrinsically a factor of five times more luminous than IRAS F10214+4724. Its far-infrared (FIR) and H{$\alpha$} luminosities and low surface-brightness radio emission are indicative of an interaction-induced starburst, and the star formation rate (SFR) could be several thousand solar masses per year. This assumes that the starburst is the dominant source of energy, but we cannot yet determine reliably the relative contributions of the starburst and the buried AGN. A dust mass of 5-7x10\^8Msolar is indicated by our data for a dust temperature of 40-50K, independent of the dominant energy source. We estimate the possible space density of such luminous submm sources, and find that while a large population of these obscured sources could be detected in future wide-field submm surveys, they are unlikely to dominate the faint counts in this waveband. Galaxies such as SMM02399-0136 and F10214+4724 cannot easily be detected in conventional AGN/QSO surveys, and so estimates of the prevalence of AGN in the early Universe may require significant revision.},

  abstract = {The SCUBA 8-mJy survey is the largest submillimetre (submm)  extragalactic mapping survey undertaken to date, covering 260 arcmin2 to a 4 {$\sigma$} detection limit of \textasciitilde =8 mJy at 850 {$\mu$}m, centred on the Lockman Hole and ELAIS N2 regions. Here, we present the results of new 1.4-GHz imaging of these fields, of the depth and resolution necessary to reliably identify radio counterparts for 18 of 30 submm sources, with possible detections of a further 25 per cent. Armed with this greatly improved positional information, we present and analyse new optical, near-infrared (near-IR) and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging to identify optical/IR host galaxies to half of the submm-selected sources in those fields. As many as 15 per cent of the submm sources detected at 1.4 GHz are resolved by the 1.4-arcsec beam and a further 25 per cent have more than one radio counterpart, suggesting that radio and submm emission arise from extended starbursts and that interactions are common. We note that less than a quarter of the submm-selected sample would have been recovered by targeting optically faint radio sources, underlining the selective nature of such surveys. At least 60 per cent of the radio-confirmed optical/IR host galaxies appear to be morphologically distorted; many are composite systems - red galaxies with relatively blue companions; just over one half are found to be very red (I - K {$>$} 3.3) or extremely red (I - K {$>$} 4); contrary to popular belief, most are sufficiently bright to be tackled with spectrographs on 8-m telescopes. We find one submm source which is associated with the steep-spectrum lobe of a radio galaxy, at least two more with flatter radio spectra typical of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), one of them variable. The latter is amongst four sources ({$\equiv$}15 per cent of the full sample) with X-ray emission consistent with obscured AGN, though the AGN would need to be Compton thick to power the observed far-IR luminosity. We exploit our well-matched radio and submm data to estimate the median redshift of the S850{$\mu$}m \textasciitilde{} 8 mJy submm galaxy population. If the radio/far-IR correlation holds at high redshift, and our sample is unbiased, we derive a conservative limit of {$<$} z{$>$} {$>$}=2.0, or {$>$}=2.4 using spectral templates more representative of known submm galaxies.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) indicate that emission from many extragalactic phenomena, including star formation and black hole accretion, in the Universe can be obscured by dust. Resolving the CIB to study the population of galaxies in which this activity takes place is a major goal of submillimetre astronomy. Here, we present interferometric 650 {$\mu$}m submillimetre number counts. Using the Band 8 data from the ALMACAL survey, we have analysed 81 ALMA calibrator fields together covering a total area of 5.5 arcmin2. The typical central rms in these fields is {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 with the deepest maps reaching {$\sigma$} = 47 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Multiwavelength coverage from ALMACAL allows us to exclude contamination from jets associated with the calibrators. However, residual contamination by jets and lensing remain a possibility. Using a signal-to-noise threshold of 4.5{$\sigma$} , we find 21 dusty, star-forming galaxies with 650 {$\mu$}m flux densities of {$\geq$}0.7mJy. At the detection limit we resolve 100 per cent of the CIB at 650 {$\mu$}m, a significant improvement compared to low-resolution studies at similar wavelength. We have therefore identified all the sources contributing to the EBL at 650 {$\mu$}m and predict that the contribution from objects with flux 0.7 mJy will be small.},

Recent major advances in observing capabilities, in particular the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory in 2009, have dramatically enhanced our ability to use this information in the context of multiwavelength studies of galaxy evolution. Near its peak, three-quarters of the cosmic infrared background is now resolved into individually detected sources. The use of far-infrared diagnostics of dust-obscured star formation and of interstellar medium conditions has expanded from extreme and rare extreme high-redshift galaxies to more typical main-sequence galaxies and hosts of active galactic nuclei out to z 2. These studies shed light on the evolving role of steady equilibrium processes and of brief starbursts at and since the peak of cosmic star formation and black hole accretion. This review presents a selection of recent far-infrared studies of galaxy evolution with an emphasis on Herschel results.},

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of {$\sim$}25 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on 5{$\sigma$} detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S1.2 mm0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 {$\mu$}m and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2\texttimes. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs\textemdash representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies\textemdash in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.},

The trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction/merger of molecular gas-rich spirals, and the bulk of the infrared luminosity for all but the most luminous objects is due to dust heating from an intense starburst within giant molecular clouds. At the highest luminosities (Lir {$>$} 1012 ), nearly all objects appear to be advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst and active galactic nucleus energy sources, both of which are fueled by an enormous concentration of molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus.

They may also represent a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxy cores, the formation of globular clusters, and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

In this pilot study, we have obtained 870-{$\mu$}m continuum maps of an essentially complete sample of the brightest 182 sub-millimetre sources ( \$S\_\{850\textbackslash, \textbackslash mu \textbackslash rm m\}\textbackslash gt \$ 6.2 mJy) in COSMOS.

We detect more than one SMG counterpart in 34 {$\pm$} 2 per cent of sub-millimetre sources, increasing to 53 {$\pm$} 8 per cent for SCUBA-2 sources brighter than \$S\_\{850\textbackslash, \textbackslash mu \textbackslash rm m\}\textbackslash gt \$ 12 mJy. We estimate that approximately one-third of these SMG-SMG pairs are physically associated (with a higher rate for the brighter secondary SMGs, \$S\_\{870\textbackslash, \textbackslash mu \textbackslash rm m\}\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 3 mJy), and illustrate this with the serendipitous detection of bright [C II] 157.74-{$\mu$}m line emission in two SMGs, AS2COS 0001.1 and 0001.2 at z = 4.63, associated with the highest significance single-dish source.

We use the extensive archival data of this field to construct the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of each AS2COSMOS SMG, and subsequently model this emission with MAGPHYS to estimate their photometric redshifts.

We have mapped fields in two massive, concentrated clusters, A370 at z ϭ 0.37 and Cl 2244Ϫ02 at z ϭ 0.33, at wavelengths of 450 and 850 mm. The resulting continuum maps cover a total area of about 10 arcmin2 to 1 j noise levels less than 14 and 2 mJy beamϪ1 at the two wavelengths, 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude deeper than was previously possible. We have concentrated on lensing clusters to exploit the amplification of all background sources by the cluster, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 1.3\textendash 2 as compared with a blank-field survey. A cumulative source surface density of (2.4 ע 1.0) \# 103 degϪ2 is found to a 50\% completeness limit of {$\sim$}4 mJy at 850 mm. The submillimeter spectral properties of these sources indicate that the majority lie at high redshift, z 1 1. Without correcting for lens amplification, our observations limit the blank-field counts at this depth. The surface density is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the expectation of a nonevolving model using the local IRAS 60 mm luminosity function. The observed source counts thus require a substantial increase in the number density of strongly star-forming galaxies in the high-redshift universe and suggest that optical surveys may have substantially underestimated the star formation density in the distant universe. Deeper submillimeter surveys with SCUBA should detect large numbers of star-forming galaxies at high redshift and so provide strong constraints on the formation of normal galaxies.},

We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, C I, H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a \textasciitilde 90\% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or infer the most likely line identification based on photometric data. This yields secure redshifts for \textasciitilde 70\% of the sample. The three sources with no lines detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.0. The resulting mean redshift of our sample is \textbackslash bar\{z\} = 3.5. This finding is in contrast to the redshift distribution of radio-identified DSFGs, which have a significantly lower mean redshift of \textbackslash bar\{z\} = 2.3 and for which only 10\%-15\% of the population is expected to be at z {$>$} 3. We discuss the effect of gravitational lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift distribution to that of models in the literature.},
